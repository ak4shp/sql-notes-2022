```  
---

### 3. WAQ to find first name of CustomerName from Customers table.
```sql
SELECT substr(CustomerName, 1, instr(CustomerName, " "))
FROM Customers;
```  
> `instr` function with `" "`  argument is giving the position of `space` .
> Providing it to the `substr`  function as the third argument, we will find first name.

### 4. WAQ to find length of CustomerName from Customers table.
```sql
SELECT length(CustomerName) FROM Customers;
```  
> `length` function gives length of string.
---  

### 5.  WAQ to find last name of CustomerName from Customers table.
```sql
SELECT Substr(CustomerName, instr(CustomerName, " ")+1,
length(CustomerName) - instr(CustomerName, " "))
FROM Customers;

```  
> Here "`length` function minus `instr`  function" gives the length of last name to be extracted.
