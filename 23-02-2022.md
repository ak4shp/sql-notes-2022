#### 1. Write a query to show all data of those customers who belong to the same city as the customer with customer id 11.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City =
(SELECT City FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 11);
```  
---  
 
#### 2. Write a query to show name of those customers who live in the same country where the customer having fourth (4th) lowest salary lives.  
```sql  
SELECT CustomerName, Country FROM Customers WHERE Country = 
(SELECT Country FROM 
   (SELECT Country, MAX(Salary) FROM 
     (SELECT Country, Salary FROM 
       Customers ORDER BY Salary ASC LIMIT 4)))
```  

> You can also use```*```  in the place of ```Country, salary``` in the third inner query.

#### Try manipulating the names, numbers, clauses  in the queries you already know. Also try to make some simple problems on your own. That way you will learn more and have a good command building logics.
